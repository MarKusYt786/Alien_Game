# 🧠 Alien Game
The Alien Game Project is a web-based game that provides an interactive experience for users. The game features a moving alien element that users can interact with to update their score. The game's logic and functionality are defined in the `script.js` file, which manipulates the HTML elements defined in the `index.html` file to create the game's interactive experience. The game's core features include moving the alien element to a random location on the screen, updating the timer display, and responding to user input.

## 🚀 Features

* Updating the timer display and checking if the game is over
* Responding to user input (mouse over the alien element) to update the score and move the alien to a new location
* Initializing the game state and starting the game intervals when the script is loaded
* Displaying the game's state, including the score and timer
